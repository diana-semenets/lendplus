                                        I come from a large family. It pushed me to want to be independent and be able to provide for myself. 
                                        I opened a small kiosk, but it was on the brink of failure and I didnâ€™t have any more money to invest in the business. One day I came across an online lending app LendPlus and decided to ask them for help and they saved my business! Now my business is up and running and I continue to use LendPlus!

                                        Harsh economic times led me to look for a business opportunity as one income from my husband was not enough to raise my family. I had previously saved small money, I sort from friends and relatives but still it was not enough. That is when a friend of mine recommended me to use LendPlus app. After applying they approved and helped me start my banana business. Ever since I have been using LendPlus app whenever I am low on cash or want to add on stock!

                                        I dropped out of school and then I started a business of collecting hides and skins from the nearby villages and selling them for a profit. I discovered later that tailoring was my calling and took a course. I started a cloth repair business. I joined LendPlus I took a loan to grow my business. I opened my own tailoring shop leather shoe making. 
                                        With the help of LendPlus I bought a secondhand heavy duty leather sewing machine! I am now stitching my way to success through tailoring business!
